#How does chatbot work
Chatbot or bot – is a computer program that assumes a natural human conversation. Users communicate with a chatbot via the chat interface or by voice, like how they would talk to a real person

There are three main types of chatbots:
-Rule-based chatbots
This is the simplest type of chatbots today. People interact with these bots by clicking on buttons and using pre-defined options. To give relevant answers these chatbots require people to make a few selections.

The chatbot – asks questions, and people answer them with buttons. The bot analyzes collected data and gives a reply.
-Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a simulation of human intelligence. AI is the area of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that work and “think” as people.
These chatbots use Machine Learning, AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand people.
